As already seen in Archon, an apocalyptic fight takes place in a fantasy surrounding, now not between &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; but between &quot;order&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot;.It all happens in a game area which is divided into 4 elemental layers. In the center is the earth layer, it is surrounded by the water layer and this is surrounded by the air layer. The outer layer is made of fire.Opposite to its forerunner the players start in Adept only with one magician (&quot;Adept&quot;) per layer. All the other creatures have to be conjured in the course of the game. Evocations and other spells cost energy, which is renewed by occupying energy points on the game area with your own creatures. The more points you occupy, the more energy you get.Every side possesses 4 own elemental beings, which have a special force when they are on their corresponding layer. Moreover 4 different demons can be conjured from both sides, which can fight independently from the chosen element. Many of these creatures can use a shooting attack, but they have also lots of special attacks.When two figures meet on a field, here also the screen is zoomed and a fight for life and death starts. The winner claims the hard-fought field.Dependent on the layer you are fighting on, the battlefield has different obstacles such as slowing-down lakes, shoot destracting swirls, flame walls or simply walls ready. The only exception are the two void fields, here no terrain is usedRating: 64.9",

    "description": "A surreal and very original game by Geoff CrammondThe game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel, a statue-like being with an energy draining stare, you begin at the lowest. &quot;Energy&quot; plays an important role, there&#x27;s a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point.The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you&#x27;re caught in his gaze, or rather the square you are standing on can be seen, you&#x27;ll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher, and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy, when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a &quot;robot hull&quot; must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground.There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a &quot;Meanie&quot; which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.",
